The project unmanned ariel vehicle delivery system focuses on using drone object which can be considered as unmanned ariel vehicle to demonstrate a simulation of drone delivery network by implementing key concepts of Graph Theory like A* algorithm, 
Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, shortest path finding in integration with logics from robotic path finding algorithm
